## About
#### The motivation behind this projects stems from my love of playing golf. In golf, each player has a handicap-index which allows for more competitive play between players of differing skill levels. Normally, the handicap-index is calculated via the USGA golf website with a membership. The equation is public knowledge so I decided to create a golf handicap calculator so I would no longer have to pay the membership fee or manually calculate my handicap every time I play another round of golf.
